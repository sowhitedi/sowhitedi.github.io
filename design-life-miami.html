				<h2>New blog series: DesignLifeMiami</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>July 23 2014</h3>

				<p>My first couple of months in my new home have proved exciting, challenging, and different from what’s come before. Miami is (obviously) a big shift from life in Mississippi, but it’s also quite different from any other city in the US—it’s almost like living in a foreign country. In fact, the city is called “Gateway to Latin America” or even “The Capital of Latin America” (and that’s not too far from the truth). Most of the people here are transplants from abroad, a vast amount of the business is international, most people speak 2 or 3 languages fluently, and it’s easier / faster / cheaper to fly to another country than it is to fly to many cities in the US.</p>

				<p>Perhaps as a result, the design / tech scene here seems largely independent of any East Coast or West Coast scene. I feel that if I’d moved to most any other US city, I would have had a number of direct or indirect connections to industry people just through my existing network of contacts. But prior to moving to Miami, I knew nobody here. It looks like Miami has its very own thing going on.</p>

				<p>So I’ve been exploring, discovering what this place has to offer, and I’ve found a lot of amazing things. Many of which are distinct to this city, and I think you should know about them! So I’ve decided to launch a blog series called DesignLifeMiami to collect and highlight some of the more interesting or unique discoveries.</p>

				<p>Here’s a (certainly not exhaustive) roundup of some of the new people and places I’ve enjoyed so far.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Büro Miami</h3>
				
				<p>For years I’ve been dying to get into a coworking space, but my city had nothing of the sort (nobody really even knew what coworking was). I was doing the home-office thing, which was OK, but I was really ready for a better working arrangement. So once I landed here, I went in search of a good space for coworking, and <a class='blog-link' href='http://www.buromiami.com/' target='_blank'>Büro</a> (located in Miami’s Midtown) has been a great fit for me. It’s amazing how much work you can get done when you’re surrounded by creative, professional people.</p>	
				
				<h3 class="blog-section">Refresh Miami</h3>

				<p>This org hosts a monthly event series focused on technology, startups, and design. Their events have food and booze and hangout time to start, and then a talk by one or more industry professionals. I was lucky to get to attend <a class='blog-link' href='https://www.refreshmiami.com/' target='_blank'>Refresh Miami's</a> June event and meet a lot of friendly, cool folks in the industry. Definitely a good event to attend.</p>			

				<h3 class="blog-section">AIGA Miami</h3>	
				
				<p>I now live in a city that has an <a class='blog-link' href='https://miami.aiga.org/' target='blank'>AIGA chapter</a>? I’m feeling all grown up. I had a chance to meet with the board members of this org and I’m planning on collaborating with them on some different projects, and I’m so thrilled for the chance to learn from them, work with them, and contribute to the design community here.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Code for MIA</h3>	

				<p>They’re a Code for America Brigade, which means that they interface with government / community organizations to help them implement and use the open web. <a class='blog-link' href=" http://codeformiami.org/" target='blank'>Code for MIA</a> hosts a weekly hack night where designers, devs, data people, and civic leaders come together to work on projects that benefit the community. Open source work is such a powerful way to give back to the community, and I’m excited to take part in what these folks are doing.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Creative Mornings</h3>	
				<p>When I found out that there’s a Miami chapter of this group, I almost cried. Seriously. This is a bit esoteric, but the first time I heard of Creative Mornings was also the first time I heard of Mike Monteiro (and it was his incomparable <a class='blog-link' href='http://creativemornings.com/talks/mike-monteiro--2/1' target='blank'>“F**** You, Pay Me”</a> talk).</p>
				
				<p>I also heard this talk right around the time I was deciding to start my own design business, and it gave me some invaluable perspective and made me believe that I really could do this solo thing. Ever since then, Creative Mornings has held a sort of legendary status in my mind, so learning that there’s a local chapter made me feel invincible. I’m excited to attend my very first <a class='blog-link' href='http://creativemornings.com/cities/mia' target='blank'>Creative Mornings Miami</a> later this week.</p>
				
				<h3 class="blog-section">lastly</h3>	
				<p>Thank you to everyone in town who has been welcoming, encouraging, and helpful as I find my way. I'm grateful! And I'm looking forward to telling stories about all of you in my DesignLifeMiami series.</p>
