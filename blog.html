				<h3 class='blog-date'>October 29, 2013</h3>
				<p>I attended a really awesome conference recently. I got to meet a lot of smart, curious, engaging people and hang out with them. Many of the folks had incredible personal stories, and many of them had career paths that wound through separate (but related) industries, and finally found a home in the line of work we have in common.</p>

				<p>After meeting and swapping stories with like-minded folks, it’s only natural to have some brews together. Fortunately, many conferences are big on drinkups. Generous companies become the patron saints of happy hour at fancy cocktail bars with rough-hewn tables and fashionably dim light bulbs.</p>

				<h3 class='blog-date'>August 28, 2013</h3>
				<p>Once, when I was in the restroom near the front of a concert hall, I could hear the evening’s performer warming up. An international star. I’ve forgotten what he played onstage that night, but I remember what I heard through the bathroom wall: Scales. Granted, he was playing double-octave <span class="blog-italic">fff</span> scales where quarter note = 144, and his notes sparkled like diamond dust as they filtered through the air ducts, but still. <span class="blog-italic">Scales</span>.</p>
				
				<h3 class="blog-section">I was a classical pianist</h3>

				<p>My first twenty-or-so minutes of every practice session went like this: warm up with scales. A few slow passes up and down the keyboard, then building in speed and intensity. The equivalent of stretching and a quick jog to get your heart rate up before a workout.</p>

				<a href='/first-job.html'><h2>How I got my first job in the industry</h2></a>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>June 5th, 2013</h3>
				<p><span class='blog-italic'>How much has luck influenced where you are in life?</span> At Greenville SC’s design / development conference <a href='http://theironyard.com/events/grok/'>Grok 2013</a>, this question sparked a debate that veered into over-large existential questions. Here’s my much less philosophical response:</p>
				
				<p>The force that’s gotten me to where I am today is of equal parts chance and personal effort. Fortunate things “just happen” to me, and yet, if I hadn’t been looking for them, those opportunities would have passed by unnoticed.</p>
				<p>So, here are two separate explanations of how I got into my first job in the design industry.</p>
