				<h2>DesignLifeMiami: Actual Disruptive Technology</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>August 8th, 2014</h3>

				<p>There’s a lot of talk about how technology can impact lives and make social change. We’ve seen some dark examples of this kind of impact lately (beating an ever-so-dead horse, but for example, the Facebook News Feed experiment), but I wanted to share a “disruptive” technology project I learned about that inspired me and helped me recover some optimism about what’s possible.</p>

				<p>Notes: If you know a little about Miami, you know that a vast number of its residents are Latin Americans, but also that no country has a bigger representation here than does Cuba (cool <a class="blog-link" href="http://miamigeographic.com/2014/04/17/maps-los-latinos-en-miami-dade/" target="_blank">population distribution maps by Matthew Toro</a>). Miami also has a rapidly growing startup and tech scene, and a number of its proponents are in fact Cuban. So it only makes sense that some of the tech that is happening here would focus on things Cuban.</p>

				<p>Which is interesting, because as I recently learned, the INTERNET is all but illegal in Cuba.</p>

				<p>As in, Cuba has the lowest internet penetration in the Western Hemisphere, with less than 5% of the population having regular and legal access to the internet. The Cuban government controls the internet, because it recognizes the potentially subversive power of technology, and has chosen to err on the side of caution.</p>

				<p>Internet access is a major privilege, and is awarded by the government to “highly trustworthy” individuals like state officials, members of the military, persons of influence, and some university students. Even this access is limited in strategic ways: it’s heavily monitored, tracked, and censored; it is extremely slow; and it is prohibitively expensive (an hour of access at an internet café costs roughly one-quarter the average Cuban's monthly income).</p>	

				<p>But the official, legal internet is hardly the only internet. </p>	
				
				<p>There’s a pretty impressive underground-technology culture happening in Cuba, where folks with a legal connection share or sell access; illegally-created email addresses abound; illegal WiFi networks snake across the country; and as <a class="blog-link" href="http://generacionyen.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/5-ios-apps-essential-for-cuba/" target="_blank"> Cuban journalist Yoani Sanchez notes</a>, you can even purchase informal-market Apple products and iOS apps. It’s estimated that anywhere from 35-50% of Cubans have some access to email, which helps them circumvent the blocks placed on normal internet access. And young people are some of the most interested parties—they see bits and pieces of what the Internet offers in other countries, and they know how powerful it is.</p>

				<p>And this is the point at which the Miami-Cuba technology story gets really interesting: there are people in the US (and specifically in Miami) who are working to help Cuban youth gain access to information and technology.</p>

				<p>At a Code for Miami Hack night, I met Cuban-born Natalia Martinez, who helps direct the non-profit <a class="blog-link" href="http://www.rootsofhope.org/" target="_blank">Roots of Hope / Raices de Esperanza</a> (Natalia is a major source for this blog story). This org helps connect young Cuban people to the information they crave through a variety of different avenues. For example, one of the major ways that information circulates in Cuba is via the distribution and sharing of USB drives—content actually goes viral as TBs worth of data are transmitted around the country on USB drives. So Roots of Hope ships these little USB sticks to Cuba, loaded with all kinds of content—some of it very simple things like magazines, movies, videos, telenovelas from Mexico; but some of it with a more educational bent, like TED talks in Spanish and coding lessons in PDF or video format.</p>	

				<p>In January this year, Roots of Hope hosted a “Hackathon for Cuba” in Miami, with the goal of building some technology solutions for the problems Cubans face. One of the winners of the hackathon, a guy named Salvi Pascual, built an email-based application that allows users to search the web, access sites like Twitter and Wikipedia, and play games online—all only using email. If a person wanted to use the service, she’d send an email to the service, and would receive a message back with instructions on how to query. She could then send a return email with a specific subject header containing a query for info about “palm trees,” and the service would return a text-only email pulled from the Wikipedia article on the subject. If you clicked a link to another article, you’d soon receive another email with the text-only content of that piece. Salvi’s project now has real live users in Cuba, and the demand is growing.</p>

				<p>What’s fascinating to me about Roots of Hope is that they work strictly within the realm of what’s legal in Cuba. They only share legal devices and technology, which means working with USBs, feature phones, email, and SMS technologies. They don’t want to get anyone into trouble or endanger anyone. They’re also 100% apolitical and non-partisan—while most things to do with Cuba are very charged, they maintain friends and collaborators on all sides of the debates.</p>	

				<p>Roots of Hope doesn’t aim to be subversive—quite the opposite, they are just working be supportive of the things that are already happening in Cuba. Ultimately, they want young people to feel empowered and to have the skills necessary to create a positive future for themselves and their families.</p>

				<p>In our industry, we talk a lot about how technology changes lives. Startups are built with the goal of doing something that’s never been done before. Tech is obsessed with the idea of “disrupting” and creating something revolutionary.</p>	
				
				<p>I’ve gotten jaded about that promise to revolutionize, create major change, disrupt. For me, the majority of what’s addressed in startup world is #firstworldproblems. A startup might offer some value or interest to a select group of people, and that’s fine, but I feel we’re diluting the meaning of some important words by slapping them on products that are basically offering entertainment. </p>	
				
				<p>As we weaken what should be powerful words, we subtly undermine the concepts behind the words. When mass media describes “a better way to order groceries online” as revolutionary, as large groups of people identify these entertainment products as conduits of change or social disruption, they lose perspective on what true change, true revolution can look like.</p>	

				<p>I’m glad to learn about a set of users with real-world challenges, who, using very un-sexy technologies like SMS and USB drives, are accomplishing astonishing things. I’m thrilled to know about a group of programmers who are committed to supporting these users. It’s beautiful to see an organization that quietly, without millions in VC funding or tons of flashy publicity, creates a careful, measured disruption in somebody’s society.</p>
