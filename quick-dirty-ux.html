				<h2>My Quick &amp; Dirty UX Process</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>July 18 2014</h3>

				<p>This week I’ve been working to resolve some user experience issues on a client project. Designing the interactions that users will have around a particular type of content, and what steps they’ll take if they want to make changes to their accounts.</p>

				<p>At this point in the project, user testing isn’t really an option, so I needed to do my own research to find the best solutions for users. Here are 4 resources that were useful to me in my process, listed in order of importance:</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">4) Browse Visual Design Collection Sites</h3>
				
				<p>Lots of people enjoy griping about <a class='blog-link' href='https://dribbble.com/' target='_blank'>Dribbble</a> and how glossy and context-less it can be. I do understand the complaints (who needs to see yet another illustrated waffle dripping with photorealistic syrup?), but it actually proves quite useful to me when looking for inspiration on how to handle UX / UI elements and even flows. Even though the designs are presented out of context, and you can’t necessarily see the flows live, you can still learn a lot by just looking at the visual solutions that other skilled designers create! Searching for the elements related to my questions (e.g. “sign in” or “log out”) brought up a wealth of shots that I could study and reference.</p>	
				
				<p>Another helpful site is <a class='blog-link' href='http://patterntap.com/' target='_blank'>PatternTap</a>, which houses a collection of UX patterns, organized by the name of the elements in question. You can browse a list of common pattern types: Comments, Error Messages, Keyboard; and then pick a pattern category to study what people have uploaded. If you’re looking to study dropdown menus, for example, you’d find a plethora of visual examples of this pattern. Another beautiful feature here is that most (all?) of the examples also have links where you can interact with a fully-functional working version of the design and test it out for yourself. No out-of-context stuff here! How cool and super useful.</p>			

				<h3 class="blog-section">3) Read A List Apart</h3>	
				
				<p>Everybody has heard of <a class='blog-link' href='http://alistapart.com/topics' target='_blank'>A List Apart,</a> right? For me, this is less of a specific-problem-solving resource and more of a use-your-brain and expand-your-thought-process kind of site. You might get hung up if you go here looking to solve a particular issue, but if you go here to educate yourself, you’ll reap huge benefits. A ton of very smart and well respected people write for this site, and in the Topics section of the site, you can browse hundreds of articles under the User Experience umbrella. The quality level of these writers is unparalleled in our industry, and you might just come across a piece that deals with exactly what you’re working on.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">2) Observe Well-designed Experiences </h3>	

				<p>You use bunch of sites that offer a top-notch user experience. And you probably visit a handful of them very frequently! The thing is, when you’re just behaving as a user, you glide through all the grooves that the UX designers have laid down, often without thinking about your experience. That’s the way it’s supposed to work; that means the designers did a fantastic job.</p>

				<p>But when you’re working to solve a UX problem yourself, slow down! Go through the flows of some of your favorite or most frequented sites and see how they did things, how it makes you feel, what you can take away from it and apply to your project.</p>
				
				<p>Also, it’s helpful to look at sites or apps that deal with a level of complexity that’s similar to the one that you’re designing. If you’re working with something relatively simple, you’ll get bogged down (or intimidated!) if you use a product with a very rich and complex user interaction as a example.</p>
				
				<h3 class="blog-section">1) Talk to Developers</h3>	
				<p>Designers like to dream, to invent, to play, to create new. This intuitive process is essential to what we do! But let’s face it: every pixel has to be implemented in living, breathing code. Our visual designs must be informed by a very practical, technical reality.</p>
				
				<p>This means that communication with my dev team is one of my most valuable resources. Patterns that I propose at an interface level have real back-end implications, and the best way to know about those implications is to talk everything through with my team.</p>
				
				<p>So I approached them and said, &#8220;Here’s what we need to accomplish for the user, and these are the surrounding criteria—What do we have to work with?&#8221;</p>
				
				<p>I’m lucky to be collaborating with some thoughtful devs who care deeply about users, understand the things we need to accomplish, and have let me know which things are practical technically and which aren’t. They also let me know when a technical decision would have further implications for the users, and how we’d need to address those issues. My team proposed a couple of different courses of action right away, and we worked through all the implications and made a decision.</p>
				
				<p>While this may not be a standard way of solving for user experience, it’s a beautifully practical one. Especially if you're in a situation where creating a user experience also means considering a particular back end framework and working within time / budget / other technical constraints. Getting feedback from my developers early in the game allowed me to make good, “implementable” decisions, and craft something that would work well—both for my client and for their users.</p>	
				
				<h3 class="blog-section">In Summary…</h3>	
				<p>Drawing on a broad set of helps is a great way to solve user experience problems. Visual and interactive inspiration, industry-standard readings, my own experiences with quality sites, and the smarts and skills of my team allowed me to resolve the issues and move forward to creating a positive, thoughtful user experience.</p>
