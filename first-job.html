				<a href='/first-job.html'><h2>How I got my first job in the industry</h2></a>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>June 5th, 2013</h3>
				<p><span class='blog-italic'>How much has luck influenced where you are in life?</span> At Greenville SC’s design / development conference <a class='blog-link'href='http://theironyard.com/events/grok/'>Grok 2013</a>, this question sparked a debate that veered into over-large existential questions. Here’s my much less philosophical response:</p>
				
				<p>The force that’s gotten me to where I am today is of equal parts chance and personal effort. Fortunate things “just happen” to me, and yet, if I hadn’t been looking for them, those opportunities would have passed by unnoticed.</p>
				<p>So, here are two separate explanations of how I got into my first job in the design industry.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">I. CHANCE / THE UNIVERSE</h3>
				<p>I was born into a middle class American family. They were big on education and personal achievement. Those threads led me to a liberal arts college.</p>
				<p>I was in Aesthetics class. A girl I’d always thought of as one of the cool kids (with whom I’d never had any interaction, as I was not one of the cool kids) approached me. <span class='blog-italic'>“It seems like you really understand this philosophy of art stuff. I have some big questions about it, and I wondered if you’d be up for doing a study session.”</span></p>
				<p>The girl became one of my best friends.</p>
				<p>Fast forward a couple of years, and the same friend was putting on her senior art exhibit. She’d hired a small ad agency to design her invites. She’d finished up a consultation with the designer and was walking out of the office when the designer stopped her.</p>
				<p>“I’m looking to hire somebody to do some work around here. Do you know anybody who would be good at that?”</p>
				<p>She thought for a second. “My friend Rebecca might be interested.”</p>
				<p>“Is she trustworthy?”</p>
				<p>“I’d trust her with my <span class='blog-italic'>life</span>.”</p>
				<p>I had a semblance of an interview, and even though I had absolutely zero experience, the designer didn’t bother with my resume, and hired me on the spot.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">II. PERSONAL EFFORT / DESIRE</h3>
				<p>I’ve always wanted to spend my life doing meaningful things.</p>
				<p>In college, I was a musician first and foremost, but also was into visual art, research, writing, philosophy, and literature. Towards the end of my junior year, I switched to a “general arts” focus which sounded cool and left me with no practical skills. I was determined to scrabble up a living, and upon graduating, took the first job I could find.</p>
				<p>Which was in a retail art framing shop. Learning the trade itself was fun: I made design decisions, assembled the frames, and worked with customers. My first month’s sales were so strong that the boss, assuming my manager had helped me too much (probably he had!), reduced my commission.</p>
				<p>I learned all I could about picture framing, and then I got antsy. I had too many ideas in my head for my life to consist only of framing watercolor society pieces and pet portraits.</p>
				<p>I told everyone I could think of that I was looking for something else. I got busy making fine art when I wasn’t at the frame shop.</p>
				<p>My friend told me about an assistant job with a graphic designer. I called the agency to set up an interview. The designer called one of my college professors to make sure that I was a hard worker and a good kid, and the rest is history.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Conclusions</h3>
				<p>A series of unlikely events led to my getting a job offer in the design industry. Years of personal development meant I was ready to take that job. At any given point, a different opportunity might have presented itself, meaning that the story could have just as easily unfolded in a different direction, but it did not.</p>
				<p>It’s not like that job was my Big Break, as I was doing some pretty menial stuff at first. But, it was one of many course-altering moments for me: <span class='blog-italic'>a moment where chance paired nicely with my skills, which meant I got a start in a field that ends up being a very, very good fit for me.</span> I’m lucky, right?</p>
