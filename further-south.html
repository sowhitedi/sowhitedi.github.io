				<p>Unpacking. After years of trying, I’ve finally left Mississippi for a new place. The house is a wreck of towering boxes and bubble wrap, but hey: we’ve located the dog, the coffeepot, and the liquor box, so we’re in good shape. :) Meanwhile, we’ve started back to work, so getting our office set up is a big priority.</p>

				<p>Moving makes you go through all the old stuff that’s been hanging out underneath your desk and crammed into the file cabinets. Sometimes that stuff is scuttled away because you don’t want to see it, but sometimes it has been put out of sight for safekeeping.</p>

				<p>When I was packing up the office in Mississippi, I came across a stack of finished fine-art drawings I’d done several years ago, ones I’d forgotten about—which is weird, since I put probably 40-80 hours into each one. They all looked better than I remembered, I thought.</p>

				<p>But then there was one drawing that gave me the existential vertigo you get when you realize past events have influenced or created future ones, and you’re suddenly seeing a possible sequence to things that previously had felt random &amp; unconnected.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">A Few Years Earlier…</h3>
				
				<p>I’m a pretty good draftsperson, and before I went solo in graphic and web design, I did some fine art commissions. Then, when I started actively pursuing freelance design work, Ramon Colas (author, activist, and Cuban expat) asked me to create cover art for a book he was writing. “Soñar al Norte, Volviendo al Sur” is the story of a Cuban guy’s passage / flight to the US, so Ramon wanted an interpretation of the Miami waterfront for his book design.</p>

				<p>I’d never been to Miami, and had never even thought about it either, so I did a good bit of image research to get a feel for the skyline and the city. I worked a lot more imaginatively with this project than I had with some other commissioned architectural drawings, and I really enjoyed the process of interpreting the skyline and creating a feeling of expectancy as the boat approaches the city.</p>

				<p>I spent so many hours meditating, thinking, feeling, envisioning MIAMI as a place and a symbol. I imagined myself there, in that boat, approaching a new place and a new life with all kinds of hopes and dreams, just like the protagonist of the book.</p>			

				<h3 class="blog-section">Fate or Whatever.</h3>	
				
				<p>In a surprising yet savory twist of “fate” or whatever, I’m writing this from my new home in Miami, where the view out back is reminiscent of the drawing I made for my friend’s book. It all happened really quickly—right opportunities at the right time—and we went from 100% in Jackson Mississippi with no idea of moving, to 100% in Miami Florida, in about a month and a half.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Next Steps.</h3>	

				<p>So White Design &amp; Illustration is getting set up in Miami! I’m looking forward to connecting with the startup &amp; design scene in Miami, especially finding a good co-working spot. Jackson MS was a great place to get started and I have a lot of great colleagues, friends, and clients there—and I’m excited about all the new possibilities here in my new city.</p>

				<p>Have any pals I should meet or cool recommendations for somebody brand new to Miami?</p>
