				<h2>Should I take this job?</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>September 25th, 2014</h3>

				<p class="blog-italic">I originally presented these thoughts in the form of a 10-minute lightning talk at the Front End Developers Miami / Miami Design meetup on September 2, 2014.</p>

				<p>This year, I found myself saying “no” to a lot of work. </p>

				<p>One day I thought about how much work / money I’d turned down, and I had to wonder, why am I doing this to myself? Am I being too difficult? Too picky?</p>

				<p>I realized that I’d turned down the work because I knew it would not be a good fit for me. Because I had taken on similar projects before and knew, from experience, that it wasn’t going to work out well.</p>

				<p>Here are some factors that help me answer the question, “Should I Take this Job?” These factors help me choose work that is a good fit for my needs and my working style.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Portfolio</h3>
				<p>As designers / developers, our portfolios are arguably more important than our resume, so we always want to keep adding great work to our portfolios. This means it’s OK (and even good practice) to turn down something you know that it isn’t in line with what you want to say about yourself. On the other hand – it’s fine to take a non-portfolio job when it fits your other needs (like money!).</p>
			
				<h3 class="blog-section">End Product</h3>
				<p>Your project will have a life of its own in the world, and will have an effect on real things and real people.</p>
				<p>This is a big one for people who do what my lawyer calls “low-bono” work. If the project is something we really care about, then we are sometimes willing accept lower pay, because we really want to see this thing take shape.</p>
				<p>On the other hand — if you have reservations about that end product – if it presents a moral / ethical conflict for you, or you think it may do harm out there in the world – then even if it would be a great portfolio piece and they’re willing to pay you very very well, you want to think twice about taking this job.</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Client</h3>
				<p>One thing that all clients have in common is that they’re humans (or a group of humans, if your client is a team or a company). Which means that there are no “simple” clients. Like humans, every single one is complex, multifaceted, and requires careful handling.</p>
				<p>A good relationship with your client makes it easy to do smart, efficient, thoughtful, powerful work. A poor relationship with your client can leave you with disastrous issues for your business and your personal sanity.</p>
				<p>You want to be able to develop a beneficial, respectful relationship with your client. This  means that you have to be able to manage their quirks and maintain a good working relationship.</p>
			
				<h3 class="blog-section">Money</h3>
				<p>We people in design and development like to say that we love what we do – but the reality is, even though we may really love designing and building things, the reason why we are professional designers and developers is because we have to earn a living.</p>
				<p>So, for this job, how’s the money? Do you feel like you’ll be compensated appropriately for your talent, skills, and hard work? Do you feel like you’re creating the same amount of VALUE for the client that you’re getting in back in financial returns?</p>

				<h3 class="blog-section">Skillset</h3>				
				<p>Each new job or project can be a chance to learn something new or improve in an area you’re already working on– whether it’s presentation skills, people skills, or technical skills: a new programming language, working with experimental color palettes, digging deeper into type design. Sometimes a new challenge is just what we need – at other times, we need to be able to just produce the work without a whole lot of fuss.</p>
			
				<h3 class="blog-section">Timeframe</h3>
				<p>Sometimes clients will tell you they want something “By Friday,” and while it’s possible to complete the work in this time, it will be a big time crunch and you might have to pull an all-nighter. On the other end of the spectrum, sometimes a job will have a timeline of 6-8 months and you KNOW it shouldn’t take that long to complete the work – which means you’ll be babysitting a very slow process.</p>

				<p><span class='blog-emphasis'>In Summary</span></p>
				<p>When I’m deciding whether to take a job, I think about the relationship between: Portfolio, End Product, Client, Money, Skillset, and Timeframe.</p>
				<p>These factors work as a sliding scale: I may feel iffy about one or two of them, but if I feel great about a few other pieces, then it’s likely to be a good fit. Sometimes the really strong “yes” on one of the factors can outweigh several “no’s.” It’s all a matter of thinking through your goals, needs and preferences, and evaluating how the job lines up with what you want.</p>
