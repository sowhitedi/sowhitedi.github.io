				<h2><a href='http://pixel-swig.com/' target='_blank'>&lt;PIXEL-SWIG&gt;</a>: What Brooklyn Beta Inspired me to Create</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>November 20, 2013</h3>

				<p>How do you know that a conference was a success? When the attendees go home armed with big ideas that they can actually execute. Sometimes conferences get you excited or hyped, and that’s a good thing; but then you return home, and, after a week, you’ve not only lost your conference-buzz, but oftentimes too, your sense of daily-life pacing. The giddy excitement leaves an energy hangover in its passing.</p>

				<p>That’s often been my experience, but not this time. <a class='blog-link' href='https://brooklynbeta.org/2013' target='_blank'>Brooklyn Beta</a> sent me home with some solid ideas, ones that I knew how to carry out.</p>


				<p>My home is currently in Mississippi, USA. It was funny to meet new people in Brooklyn, because Mississippi remains a vivid stereotype for a lot of people. Some folks seemed amused that a girl who presents as normal &amp; competent could hail from the Deep South, but most people were just curious.</p>

				<p><span class='blog-emphasis'>The Number 1 question I got:</span></p>
				
				<p><span class='blog-italic'>“What’s the design community like in Mississippi?”</span></p>
			
				<p><span class='blog-italic'>“…Uh…?”</span></p>

				<p>Don’t get me wrong, there’s good stuff happening here: good design, good illustration, good development. There are pockets of people in the industry that are connected through families, agencies, or other social groups.</p>

				<p>But as an industry, there’s nothing specifically built for us. We don’t know each other. We don’t have a space to hang out. There’s nothing centralized or discoverable for newcomers. A lot of people are isolated from each other.</p>

				<p><span class='blog-italic'>I explained this probably 20 or 30 times.</span></p>

				<p><span class='blog-emphasis'>Then, I realized: I can probably do something about this.</span></p>

				<p>So when I got back home, I approached my good friend <a class='blog-link' href='http://www.cmattisonillustration.com/#!home/mainPage'>Christina Mattison</a>, a fantastic children’s book illustrator. She loved my impulse, and we worked together to form the idea.</p>

				<p>It’s called <a class='blog-link' href='http://pixel-swig.com/' target='_blank'>&lt;PIXEL-SWIG&gt;</a>, a social &amp; professional gathering for illustrators, designers, &amp; developers. It’s a happy hour series designed to bring creative professionals together in the same room, so we can enjoy beverages, swap stories, and make connections. We’re all about an open, friendly creative community.</p>

				<p>A thriving design community means people can build side projects together. It means that startups can begin to develop in our midst. It means you know who your local peers are, and you know who to ask for feedback or critique. It means healthy competition and staying on your toes. It means that the next time somebody needs to hire a developer, they’ll probably think of you, since you just shared drinks and conversation the other night at an industry gathering.</p>

				<p>This kind of community doesn’t happen overnight, and it takes a lot of commitment to build. For now, <a class='blog-link' href='http://pixel-swig.com/' target='_blank'>&lt;PIXEL-SWIG&gt;</a> is simply meant to get people into the same room and create a few ripples in this town.</p>

				<p>We’ve already seen a good response—the community is wrapping is arms around us. A super cool speakeasy agreed to let us gather at their place for our first event, and a local print shop has picked up the tab for our print invites.</p>

				<p><a class='blog-link' href='http://pixel-swig.com/' target='_blank'>&lt;PIXEL-SWIG&gt;</a>’s first happy hour is December 10th from 5-7 PM at The Apothecary at Brent’s Drugs in Fondren, Mississippi. If you’re local or just happen to be in the area, come join us!</p>

				<p>Big thanks to all the Brooklyn Beta crew: you inspired me to start this side project / event series and make a small investment towards building a design community in Mississippi.</p>
