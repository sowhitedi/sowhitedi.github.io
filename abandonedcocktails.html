				<h2>Abandoned $16.00 cocktails: Why you should always tip during Open Bar</h2>
				<h3 class='blog-date'>October 29, 2013</h3>
				<p>I attended a really awesome conference recently. I got to meet a lot of smart, curious, engaging people and hang out with them. Many of the folks had incredible personal stories, and many of them had career paths that wound through separate (but related) industries, and finally found a home in the line of work we have in common.</p>

				<p>After meeting and swapping stories with like-minded folks, it’s only natural to have some brews together. Fortunately, many conferences are big on drinkups. Generous companies become the patron saints of happy hour at fancy cocktail bars with rough-hewn tables and fashionably dim light bulbs.</p>

				<p><span class='blog-italic'>Sponsored drinkups are incredibly fun.</span> You can have as many as you want and nobody will ever present you with a bill, because a benevolent company has already taken care of it. Your friends order things for you; you venture to try new things that you wouldn’t typically get without tasting from someone else’s glass first. You enjoy wandering about from table to table, because after all, no server is trying to keep tabs on you to make sure you pay your bill. It’s a fun, carefree environment.</p>

				<p><span class='blog-italic'>Sponsored drinkups are incredibly crowded</span>, as everyone wants to get in there and get theirs. Swanky low key clubs are filled to (over?) capacity and get very very loud; everyone is shouting because everyone else is shouting, and that’s what you’ve got to do to be heard. You have to elbow in to get a spot at the bar to place an order, unless someone who is exiting the bar has mercy on you and kindly opens up a space for you to get in. Then, you probably have to wait a few minutes to place an order, since the barkeep is getting dozens of orders every minute from all the new and returning enjoyers of the generous pours.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>The bartender was working at speed, mixing three or four complex cocktails at once, with assembly-line precision that only comes after a few years’ constant practice. She reached below the bar for some obscure ingredient, added it to the mix, and replaced the container below the bar, all without looking. She knew right where everything was. It was all muscle memory. Her face was blank with focus and concentration.</p>

				<p>A server brought a round to my table; people had migrated since they’d placed orders, so she had trouble getting glasses into the right hands. She was literally shouting out the drink names, and we still couldn’t hear her. Someone had departed the table for elsewhere, so she said, <span class='blog-italic'>“Well, I’m just going to leave this here,”</span> and plunked that exquisite $16.00 no-longer-wanted cocktail down next to the rest of the half-consumed, forgotten beverages on the table.</p>

				<br>

				<p>These scenarios are typical in cities, on weekends, and in popular bars. The noise, the drunk, the grind. It’s all part of the job.</p>

				<p>Know what else is part of the job? Gratuity. Tips. On a typical night, these talented servers and bartenders are bringing in some serious cash for their efforts.</p>
				<p>Too often at sponsored drinkups, tips appear few and far between. Once we’ve been absolved of exchanging cash or signatures for the alcohol we consume, it’s all too easy to forget about the wait staff. We are often too focused on the amazing party to think about anything else. 20% is the furthest thing from our minds.</p>

				<br>
				<p>That night, I could feel the stress that the staff was under; it was palpable. I could sense how much pressure they were experiencing, dealing with that outsized crowd. They were pulling out all the stops, and I couldn’t feel good about just taking without giving anything back.</p>
				<p>That incredible bartender was making drinks faster than I could track them, and I was totally impressed with the huge effort she was putting out. When I got my beverage, I handed over a modest tip to say thanks.</p>
				<p>She looked up: brief eye contact, a smile of recognition. Then back to the row of half-constructed cocktails.</p>
				<p>Later, at that table after the confusion over the abandoned drink, I ordered some fantastical combo that included celery juice and other things I can’t now remember. When the server brought the cocktail, I pushed some bills onto her tray.</p>
				<p><span class='blog-emphasis'>This is how I know the tips thing really was a big deal: there was this look on her face of “wow, somebody finally noticed what I’m going through here, and somebody sees how hard I’m working.” There was a definite quality to her voice when she said “thank you.”</span></p>
				<br>
				<p>Think about some of your volunteer / pro-bono work (or whatever else you want to call it) and see if you don’t agree: service can be under-appreciated when it’s free. If they didn’t pay anything for your services to begin with, they often have a diminished sense of the value of your work.There’s no penalty to them for wasted time, duplicated effort, lost energy. If they don’t have any skin in the game, they don’t worry much about being indecisive, impulsive, asking for more and more and more. Because it didn’t cost them anything, they do not value the product (or its creator) the same as a paying customer does.</p>
				<p>It’s ironic but true: you have to work extra hard at managing volunteer / pro-bono clients in order to get the same level of respect and thanks you’d get from a paying customer.</p>
				<p>It really, really sucks to be under-appreciated when you’re working your ass off. It’s even worse to get under-paid when you’re working your ass off.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Not tipping is not cool. Gratuity is part of the social contract in the US, and restaurant and bar industry workers absolutely depend on it. As I mentioned before, I know that Booze Benefactors take this into account. But I’m arguing that we blissful recipients of Open Bar should go above and beyond.</p>
				<p>Maybe these incredibly skilled servers and bartenders enjoy their line of work and want to keep at it for a long time. Maybe this is a temporary job that they’re using to help fund that side venture that will someday become their full time gig. Either way, they have personal stories just as interesting as any you’ll hear at a conference during the day, and are certainly as deserving of respect and proper pay for their work. We place a huge value on the chance to meet and interact with others in our industry; let’s make sure that we share the love with those who make our events so enjoyable.</p>
				<p>So next time you’re at a sponsored drinkup, remember to take care of the staff. Be intentional about showing gratitude—and help make up for the outrageous size and antics of your party. Encourage your fellow celebrants to do the same! Carry some cash with you and tip for each beverage. Are you cash-averse? A friend of mine asks the server to run a $0.01 charge on his credit card at the end of the night, and adds correct gratuity to that (don’t forget that it costs the establishment something to run your card).</p>
				<p>Also, if you’re planning an event like this, make sure to recommend good tipping practices when you communicate with your attendees. People are generally well-intentioned; they just need well-timed reminders.
